<Changes in Prices>

1) Have prices changed? If yes, by how much
Line-item level
> Yes. Measured this by looking at how much top 20 most repeatedly ordered product by productName. I could not really simplify and distill the items ordered based on productName

Aggregate level
> Hard to tell. Calculated the total expenditure per organization per month. Set expenditure in Jan 2021 as 1. Index monthly expenditure after Jan 2021 to Jan 2021. 
>> Just by looking at those for which we have data consistently from Jan '21 to Jan '23, it's quite mixed and all over the place. Can't discern a consistent increase.

<Purchasing Behavior>
1) 



1) have prices changed
2) if yes, by how much 
3) how has purchasing behavior changed:
a) are people buying different things? i.e. has the "basket" changed 
b) are people buying in a different way (more frequently) - we looked at this last year
4) which items rose in base price as part of "GST rise"
